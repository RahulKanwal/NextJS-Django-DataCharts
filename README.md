# Blockhouse Dashboard

A simple project which I created to display charts in a NextJS application. It takes data from Django APIs. I have created 4 APIs in Django. In NextJS project, I have used observable charts and D3 charts to display various charts like candlestick chart, bar chart, line chart, and pie chart.
